          I approached Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) early in 2013, with
          art-director Pablo Videla, to see if we could help on any projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          They asked if we could come up with a stunt for their Global Day of
          Action on Military Spending on 15th April. We provided them with a
          selection of ideas, one of which they developed into the above.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stunt took place outside the Houses of Parliament and featured
          protestors from CAAT, CND, Disarm DSEi and Pax Christi.
