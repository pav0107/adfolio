          The above piece was for a pharmaceutical client who had a stand at
          2013's ESC (European Society of Cardiology) Congress, regarded as the

          The brief was to have posters along a walkway to advertise the stand.

          busily trying to get around was going to be tricky.

          I thought a better idea was to use live illustration. This led to four
          artists creating a 60m-long illustration, live over the course of the
