        An internal poster for Dying Matters' Awareness Week to advertise a talk
        for staff about the discounted will writing service on offer. The poster
        was based on the insight that, as it was during lunchtime, people may be
        more interested in getting some food.

        The brief for the internal poster, above, was to tackle the
        misconception by some Macmillan staff that when we talked about
        'Macmillan professionals' we were just talking about nurses.

        We were asked to design a poster to raise awareness of data protection,
        security and reputational risk. We thought that using the founder,
        Douglas Macmillan, would be an eye-catching way of doing this.

        This internal poster was designed to let staff know about the learning
        and development opportunities available within the charity. Our solution
        to the brief was to use the well-known face of our CEO, Linda Thomas,
        and her position as someone to aspire to.
