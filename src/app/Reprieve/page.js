          The brief for the poster above was to advertise a night of comedy
          marking the end of George Bush's presidency: one that's been
          catastrophic for the world, but great for comedians. The obvious thing
          to do was to make a joke about George Bush, but that had been done to
          death. Instead, I thought it would be more interesting and effective
          to show how comparatively difficult the world of Obama would be for
          comics.

          I designed the following T-shirts to raise money for Reprieve through
          sales on their website.

          Redacted text was commonly encountered by Reprieve's lawyers when
          dealing with the people they represented in Guantanamo Bay so I
          thought the visual comparison between that and the stripes of the US
          flag would work well. I also wanted the redacted text to be
          appropriate too, rather than just random words, so I used Article 1 of
          the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:
        </p>

        <p>
          All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They
          are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one
          another in a spirit of brotherhood.
