          I've been performing stand-up since 2011 at clubs across the UK and
          Europe.

          In 2016 I won the Bath Comedy Festival New Act of the Year Competition
          with a set that received this review:
        </p>
        <p className="italic">
          '... This year’s winner, though, is Pav, who gives an intellectually
          thoughtful, though never patronising or preachy take on racism,
          genocide, social attitudes, and history generally, with a beautifully
          measured and timed delivery, every wry gag hitting its mark with a
          devastating accuracy that has the audience roaring. Comedy with brains
          and brawn. It’s a fitting end to a great festival.'
        </p>
        <p>
          I also got through to the semi-final of the 2017 BBC New Comedy
          Awards. The set I did in the heats to reach this can be seen above.
